# UFOs

## Overview of Project ##

The purpose of this project was to provide an analysis of UFO sightings across the world by allowing users to filter through UFO sighting data by date, city, state, country and shape. 

## Results ## 

When you first open the webpage, the search criteria is blank allowing you to see all of the UFO sighting data listed. On the left of the page, you will see filter search, with 5 different search catergories:
- Enter a Date
- Enter a City
- Enter a State
- Enter a Country
- Enter a Shape

Each catergory has an example of the criteria it is looking for. When you enter a certain criteria into one of the catergories and press the enter key, the table will adjust to show you the results for the criteria you entered. For example, if we add "el cajon" into our search, 5 results will appear when I press enter. 


Even after you have entered one search criteria, you can add another and select enter again to filter even further. Using these 5 results from el cajon, I will add "triangle" into my shape criteria field, and there are two entries that occured in **el cajon** and were a **triangle** shape.  


Once you see the results for the search you have entered and would like to begin a new search, simply click the UFO Sightings, or reload the page, to reset you search criteria and do it again!
