# **UFOs Sightings**

## Overview of Project ##

The purpose of this project was to provide an analysis of UFO sightings across the world by allowing users to filter through UFO sighting data by date, city, state, country and shape. 

## Results ## 

When you first open the webpage, the search criteria is blank allowing you to see all of the UFO sighting data listed. On the left of the page, you will see filter search, with 5 different search catergories:
- Enter a Date
- Enter a City
- Enter a State
- Enter a Country
- Enter a Shape

Each catergory has an example of the criteria it is looking for. When you enter a certain criteria into one of the catergories and press the enter key, the table will adjust to show you the results for the criteria you entered. For example, if we add "el cajon" into our search, 5 results will appear when I press enter.

Even after you have entered one search criteria, you can add another and select enter again to filter even further. Using these 5 results from el cajon, I will add "triangle" into my shape criteria field, and there are two entries that occured in **el cajon** and were a **triangle** shape.

Once you see the results for the search you have entered and would like to begin a new search, simply click the UFO Sightings, or reload the page, to reset you search criteria and do it again!


## Summary ## 
In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
One drawback of this design is that the search criteria must match exactly to the data. For example, when the search criteria "ca" is entered there are many results, but if "CA" is entered, then no results populate. 

Two recommendations for further delevelopment would be:
1) All of the sightings in our data are from the US, so I would remove that search criteria and replace it with duration. People interested in UFO sightings would probably like to see if the durations in certain areas are similar within that area, and how they vary from different locations. 
2) Another development I would look into, is making the text entered different than the example text. This way you still have the example text if you would like to enter another search criteria, but you still identify the criteria you have already entered. Currently all the text looks the same when entered, so it can be difficult to know what the results are filtered on.
